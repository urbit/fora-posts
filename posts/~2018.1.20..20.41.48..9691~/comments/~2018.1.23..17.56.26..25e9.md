This strikes me as slightly overdesigned.  I don't like being a big spender with the hints.  

There is a lot of data from the Hoon type system that we could leak into hints.  We could just throw the types in directly.  But hints are a sort of unspecified contract with the interpreter, and especially when our interpreter is so immature I'm uncomfortable stepping out into this undiscovered country.

The proposed Nock 12, basically %= in Nock (~fodwyt and I have talked about this in private) might help analyzing your 9s a bit, though it's not going to resolve an indirect branch target statically.  But some level of runtime analysis ("tracing jit") is going to be necessary in a serious interpreter anyway, so...

Also, interpreter implementers need to remember that we simply can't guarantee that any Nock formula is actually executed with the subject it's designed to be executed with.  It has to work correctly anyway.  Giving Hoon types or any other such information to Nock doesn't really gain us much when we remember that Nock doesn't actually enforce the Hoon type system.
