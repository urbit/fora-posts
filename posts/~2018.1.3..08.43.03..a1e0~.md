To the point: in the near feature we will see completion of collections.Some martians are already hosting blogs with pictures inside Urbit. In the feature we will definitely see brave pioneers writing google, twitter, and youtube replacements in Urbit. Which brings us to the question: what is the Future Of Storage in Urbit?

AFAIK, current 32-bit design limits us (no paging) to 2GB of mapped data. What steps will be necessary to make it possible to have access to arbitrary amounts of data from inside of Urbit?
I would imagine first step would be making Urbit 64-bit, but then what happens next?

While question of hosting 100TB of data is not yet very much relevant, hosting data above the current limit of 2GB will become more pressing as people will seriously start using collections, with the introduction of video chat to some future form of talk etc.

Hopefully we will have High Tlon Officials shed some light.
