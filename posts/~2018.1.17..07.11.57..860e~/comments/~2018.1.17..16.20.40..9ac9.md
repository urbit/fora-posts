Given the way that Urbit works we can never prevent user-side customization of the UI. Because of this, I think we're better off supporting it as explicitly as possible. 

There will always be a 'default' or 'factory-made' look and feel. This is what you get over the network. I think it makes sense to provide even further customization than what we find with Facebook, et al by default. Color scheme, for example, feels to me like something we should allow people to customize very easily.

Running a completely different look and feel will always be up to the user, though. And you could get that new look and feel by syncing something over the network. I wonder whether this shouldn't be accommodated by default — that you can browse user-generated themes. I don't see myself using one, but I like think allowing for experimentation here could be really great. 

Ideally we can also separate these areas of work cleanly. That is, you should be able to run a separate UI without changing any of the urbit-side code. Your data and applications remain the same, but you slap on a different view. That'd be great.
