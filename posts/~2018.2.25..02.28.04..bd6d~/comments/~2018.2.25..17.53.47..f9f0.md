The forward/backward patch discussion is very interesting. Git for obvious reasons allows for diff to go both ways: but that's only because text is easy.

It seems if we restrict that patch direction is set in stone for a particular clay node and cannot be retroactively changed, the code complication would not be unmanageable, maybe.

On the other hand I feel like forward semantic patches are much more important case. They flow in the direction of the arrow of time; irreversible processes are always forward patched.

The case for reversible back patchable processes has some appeal, but for me it seems what we are after, while technically being a patch, is more like a "point of view".

For me, patch is primarily about new information: and this always forward flowing (and naturally semantical) 

You can say going back in time is also a kind of a "patch", but maybe we could accommodate it inside forward diff framework.

Perhaps that example be best implemented using other means. Does this kind of scenario is really best suited for using revision control on a single json structure?
A Gall app could store actual thread messages in clay, and they carry inherent forward patch semantics. The polling best be left for pokes to Gall. Handling that in a revisionless indexable list seems suitable.
