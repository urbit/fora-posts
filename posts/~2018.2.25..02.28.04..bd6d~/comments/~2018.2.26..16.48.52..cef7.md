I had another idea about clay tracker (eye?). I think Urbit Eye should be universal urbit google search. The thing about hierarchical filesystems, is that they are not really suitable for humans as such. To this day no one has found the solution to the problem of devising an organisational scheme for folders within a filesystem. The existing hierarchies are usually enforced by software (kernel, DE and so on) and when left to the user devolve into mess (just look into average /home).

As such, google offered a much better alternative: you specify what you are after and it gives you that. 

The paths/url are a good way of identifying and sharing resources, same in urbit. 

My ideal tracker is a white page with a single input bar in the style of google search. As you type your resources start appearing. You can do local and global search, or apply many filters. 
Depending on the content type, different urbit applications are launched if you click on them. 

The traditional folder view (urbit drive) becomes just one of the ways to explore the filesystem, in many cases the least preferable, but still available. Different applications could specify the mark they want to handle and could be launched accordingly, same as in traditional operating system ("open with")
