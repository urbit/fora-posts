samsef, I fail to see a difference between IM and email. 
1.  Email is definitely as synchronous as IM and as asynchronous as IM.
2. The other things are an UI problem. Nothing prevents us from having good UI for longer
     messages. You will just choose a different button ("Compose") in the messenger. 
     Good email clients order by threads anyway (or by time, or by x, I mean you don't receive your mails in random order ;-))

After all, there is nothing special about email. Just it is a widely used messaging protocol, which is horrible, outdated, but works. 

If you have some specific feature which you think would be absent, just make sure to leave it here. 
I will be getting to an alternative Talk UI in the near future. 

I feel like a lot of martians assume they will be forced to type long messages in current webtalk ui. Not at all. We will definitely have slight variation of UI for different needs.
