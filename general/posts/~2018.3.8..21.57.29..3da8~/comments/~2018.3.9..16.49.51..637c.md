First of all, for the record, I am a perfectly capable and trustworthy house-sitter thank you very much. (;

I agree with ~risruc, the reputation/trust system itself really shouldn't care for how reputation gets determined/assigned. If I want to give you +1t trust simply because I like the memes you're posting, I should be able to do so. People may opt out of using my trust-list as recommendation though, so I should keep that in mind. And the entire system should clearly indicate this: probably want to be serious about it.

+1 for trust > reputation. Guess you could say "trust" is the value any one ship assigns to any other ship, and "reputation" is an aggregate trust score gathered from an arbitrary number of sources.
