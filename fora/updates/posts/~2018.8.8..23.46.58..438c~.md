Here’s a short update from the team at Tlon for the week of `~2018.8.8`:

![1.](https://media.urbit.org/fora/updates/~2018.8.8-Update-1.jpeg)

The Interface team spent another week completing the new Urbit frontend. **Gavin** `~ridlur-figbud` finished up his project for putting an image to your `@p` (“pat-P”) (image is teaser). **Galen** `~ravmel-ropdyl` and **Jimmy** `~haptyl-wanwes` did another round of design reviews for a couple of our interfaces. **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn` implemented Landscape functionality to reconnect to your Urbit after a long period of disconnection (we _never_ leave `:talk`, so we of course wouldn’t know about that). **Logan** `~tacryt-socryp` fixed some more iOS bugs and implemented mobile in-app caching of Collections, making the app more feature-complete. **Isaac V** `~davtyr-nimren` continued the Collections redesign (code  [here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/collections-redesign)).

The Infrastructure team put another week in forming a more perfect kernel. **Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` continued bug hunting in his Ford Turbo cache implementation. **Elliot** `~littel-ponnys` has Ford Turbo integrated with all of Arvo now, but some last steps are still needed to be able to fully remove old Ford from the system. You can find Ted and Elliot’s code [here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/branches/all?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=ford-turbo), and their technical updates are posted to Fora [here](https://fora.urbit.org/proposals/posts/~2018.3.15..04.24.35..a47f~/).
As Ford Turbo has approached completion, we’ve realized major performance bottlenecks in our Hoon compiler. So we’ve called upon **Paul** `~fodwyt-ragful` to help make Hoon really fast. Ted’s parallelism UP has also some gotten comments since it was posted last week -- check out the proposal [here](https://fora.urbit.org/proposals/posts/~2018.7.28..19.57.33..7ed3~/). 

The Keys team got us another week closer to getting on chain. **Joe** `~master-morzod` now has ships booting from the keys in our testnet contract. **Travis** `~rigdyn-sondur` finished implementing our much-needed `secp256k1` crypto jet (code [here](https://github.com/urbit/secp256k1)). **Mark** `~palfun-foslup` nearly completed his `argon2-wasm` library for key generation/derivation. Our man **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn` is helping him integrate it with our other front end libraries (code [here](https://github.com/urbit/argon2-wasm)). **Anthony** `~poldec-tonteg` and **Morgan**  `~hidrel-fabtel` are busy folding all of this new functionality into Urbit Wallet to help you manage your ships. **Robert** `~lodleb-ritrul` is working on the copy for all of these apps, so that their functionality is crystal clear to users.

Lastly: We’re throwing a party next Friday, August 17th. Link: [meetup.com: Urbit IRL ~2018.8](https://www.meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/253292678/). Be there!

See you on Talk, Martians.
