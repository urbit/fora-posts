We’ve had a busy past few weeks here at Tlon -- here’s an update:

We hired some people! We’ve added to the full-time team:

- **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn`
- **Jimmy** `~haptyl-wanwes`
- **Morgan**  `~hidrel-fabtel`
- **Anthony** `~poldec-tonteg`
- **Elliot** `~littel-ponnys`

Tonight we’re hosting a [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/248852261/) at the Tlon office. It’s a party. Morgan is DJing. Galen’s showing Beat Takeshi movies on the back wall. Bring your laptop, and we can write Fizzbuzz in Hoon together. Or just relax, have some drinks, and talk to the weird array of people who also want to replace the internet. 

**Curtis** `~sorreg-namtyv` is in the Netherlands this week visiting **Mark** `~palfun-foslup`. They’re self-auditing the last parts of the [Urbit constitution](https://github.com/urbit/constitution). While sitting in Gatwick Airport, Curtis also wrote up some ideas he’s been thinking about. Check out these essay drafts, posted to Fora:

- [The Urbit public record [draft]](https://fora.urbit.org/posts/~2018.3.23..03.42.41..ab6d~)
- [Spirit and practice of digital homecoming [draft]](https://fora.urbit.org/posts/~2018.3.22..19.46.35..3499~)

**Galen** `~ravmel-ropdyl`, **Anton** `~pittyp-datfyn`, **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn`, **Jimmy** `~haptyl-wanwes`, and **Anthony** `~poldec-tonteg` have been working more on the new Urbit frontend.

**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer`, **Elliot** `~littel-ponnys`, and **Keaton** `~tonlur-sarret` authored and published an Urbit Proposal (UP) on New Ford:

- [UP 4 - Ford Turboencabulator](https://fora.urbit.org/posts/~2018.3.15..04.24.35..a47f~)

It’s a monster post, but if you’re a systems geek and want to read into the redesign of this important kernel module, check it out.

Ted’s and Elliot’s daily Ford progress can be tracked here:

**Joshua** `~taglux-nidsep`, Ted, and Keaton debuted _Mars Talk, Season 2_ on Wednesday night. To reboot the show, we gave a high-level overview of the Urbit stack for new developers:
