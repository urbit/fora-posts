**Galen** `~ravmel-ropdyl`, **Jimmy** `~haptyl-wanwes`, and **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn` continue work on the new Urbit front-end.

**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` and **Mark** `~palfun-foslup` finished their month-long project of labelling the Arvo issues.

`~palfun` says:
After moving over Arvo-related issues from the Vere repository, Arvo hit >100 open issues. Knowing a lot is wrong is the first step towards making a better product, but a big ol' pile of issues isn't really conducive to that. After [proposing](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues/572) a set of labels for our repositories to use, `~rovnys` and I set out to show all the issues some love.  
Today we finally made it through the last of them! You can now look for issues that are [easy](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22difficulty+low%22) or [good for contributors](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+contributor+issue%22) to tackle. There's plenty of labels now for all your filtering needs. Internally, we'll try to get eyes on issues labeled [RFC](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22request+for+comments%22) and [help wanted](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) every so often.  
While contributors can't add labels themselves, we'll make sure your issues get tagged correctly. Enjoy!

**Curtis** `~sorreg-namtyv` has been helping Ted and **Anton** `~pittyp-datfyn` with Ford. He’s also continued his work on improving default values for types in Hoon.

**Keaton** `~tonlur-sarret` has been working on a super-secret project that he cannot discuss. Loose lips sink ships ...

**Mark** `~palfun-foslup` has submitted a PR for Clay permissions. We just completed a second round of review, and Mark is now doing more testing.

**Iceman** `~littel-ponnys`, **Joe** `~master-morzod`, and Ted [had some fun](https://fora.urbit.org/posts/~2018.2.9..21.50.49..709f~/) discussing various forms of persistence in Clay and Gall in `urbit-meta`.

Keaton and Ted demoed some Urbit web app examples in [Mars Talk Episode 20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emWy1Afe4qY).
