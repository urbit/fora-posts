Hi Martians -

I’d like to present some works I’ve been noodling on for the last two weeks or so, as an assist of sorts to some simple-app use cases `~tonret-sigsur` and `~dorlun_sibnus` have been working on. 

Here is a link to some static-designs representing Feed, Link, Mesh, and a sampling of other small interfaces:

https://www.figma.com/file/NgBtgxf20tE2xO6VzRfIvwQd/Urbit-Apps

The link should be viewable without an account, but if you’d like to see my annotations (which include a lot of context and reasoning behind some decisions I made) and/or leave some of your own, you’ll need to make a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) account (it’s a great free solution to interface designing in the browser).

I’ve attempted to translate the above into some basic prototypes here, these are still WIP and heavily under development: https://codepen.io/collection/DLbWke/

I plan on translating each of the static Figma-based designs into interactive prototypes very soon, to better gauge usability.

As a bonus, here is a file displaying the initial run of interfaces displayed in during the 2017 star sale — I was enamored with the idea of a **Helpful Console** and wanted to see how the interface would perform on mobile devices. Still heavily WIP:

Along with the use cases explored above, I’ve been considering other useful applications that’d get me (a decidedly not-as-technical-as-most-of-you urbit user) using Urbit for simple and frequent tasks. Ideally, these simple apps would warm people up to the idea of performing light computation or tasks on our baby computer-network.

I plan on adding more to this list as inspiration dictates.

### Utilities

## Slides

Refer to https://slides.com for an ideal web-based slide-building app. Feature set could be pared down to the point of text insertion/placement, code block placement, image placement, and a simple grid.

## Event Scheduler

A simple hour-by-hour scheduler — allows two or more ships to agree on an interval of time to meet. Refer to https://beta.doodle.com  or https://www.when2meet.com

## Notes

Simple markdown note taking (Technically this is possible with .md files and clay+tree, but a dedicated interface for writing, styling, and searching for notes would be nice). When I think of best-in-class simple text-editing apps, Notational Velocity and Notes.app come to mind. Being able to add simple drawings to textual notes would also be cool.

### Media

## eBook reader

A simple reader that sources books from a nested directory (maybe import calibre libraries/metadata?).
Could use a modified https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js as a front end maybe. A simple server for sharing electronic books with friends has been a long-time dream of mine.

## Reading Bookmarklet/Annotation Storage

A service like this could go hand-in-hand with an eBook app, in the sense that both ‘pages read online’ and ‘books’ could be collated into a ship-based library/knowledge store.

It goes without saying that these are all sketches, and I plan on doing at least one or two more passes on these collectively. Ideally, each of these demo-apps would be available as modules to view and use on something like Github, though I could see them residing in Urbit documentation, similar to how 'Static Pages' and 'Blogs' are exemplified presently.

Any feedback, positive or negative, is encouraged — I enjoy a good critique. There are no guarantees I will implement feedback in further iterations.

Thanks.
