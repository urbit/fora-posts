**Galen** `~ravmel-ropdyl`, **Jimmy** `~haptyl-wanwes`, and **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn` worked on the upcoming frontend overhaul, including the new homepage, the _Collections_ and _Streams_ apps, and the primer. **Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` and **Anton** `~pittyp-datfyn` continued to work on Ford.

**Curtis** `~sorreg-namtyv` worked on fixing the defaulting behavior in Hoon. “The future is not wonky,” he declares.

**Keaton** `~tonlur-sarret` tested Isaac V’s Fora implementation using his static `ren/tree`. It works.

**Mark** `~palfun-foslup` gave a presentation at the FOSDEM open source conference in Belgium. Video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-QBW6QIDto).

**Isaac V** `~davtyr-nimren` completed the initial version of the static `ren/tree` replacement. The _Collections_ and _Streams_ apps are now being built on top of this foundation. See the [`mve` branch](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/mve) of Arvo to track development.

**Paul** `~fodwyt-ragful` [fixed a performance issue](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/920) in unifying large nouns.

**Iceman** `~littel-ponnys`’s testing framework has been merged into master. To use the framework to write unit tests, see the [user guide](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/master/web/testing.umd). This pull request also includes a Hoon port of [Haskell’s Prelude](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.1.0/docs/Prelude.html), which is [now available](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/master/lib/new-hoon.hoon) as an alternate version of the Hoon standard library, including [unit tests](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/master/tests/new-hoon). Discussion of this subject can be found on [Fora](https://fora.urbit.org/posts/~2017.10.17..04.09.16..7eb8~/).

On [Mars Talk Episode 19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Fjnv0RcR0) (our 20th episode!) this week, Keaton and Ted explained Ford, Urbit’s functional reactive build system.
