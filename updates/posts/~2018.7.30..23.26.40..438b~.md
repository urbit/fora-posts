Here’s a short update from the team at Tlon for the week of `~2018.7.30`:

The Keys team worked more this past week on specifying and implementing the plan to get the Urbit constitution on the Ethereum blockchain. **Anthony** `~poldec-tonteg` and **Morgan**  `~hidrel-fabtel` have nearly completed updating the specification for Wallet. **Will** `~hadrud-lodsef` and **Keaton** `~tonlur-sarret` have a better idea of how to create a smooth experience for current address-space holders to generate their Ethereum keys and get them to us to put in the contract. **Mark** `~palfun-foslup` and **Travis** `~rigdyn-sondur` spent the week implementing more crypto jets (code: [`urbit/argon2`](https://github.com/urbit/argon2)), and Mark is also working on an `argon2` WebAssembly library  (code: [`urbit/argon2-wasm`](https://github.com/urbit/argon2-wasm)), which will help us generate private keys during onboarding. **Robert** `~lodleb-ritrul` is now working with us to write user documentation for all of the processes that will be part of our key generation and management applications. We can’t wait for Urbit ownership to be cryptographically real.

The Infrastructure team spent the week making the Urbit computer more beautiful. **Curtis** `~sorreg-namtyv` worked more on Hoon improvements and started work on the Tlon-official Hoon style guide. **Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` and **Elliot** `~littel-ponnys` completed several Ford Turbo design changes and got all their tests passing again, now working on completing caching implementation and Eyre integration (code [here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/branches/all?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=ford-turbo), technical updates [here](https://fora.urbit.org/proposals/posts/~2018.3.15..04.24.35..a47f~/)). **Joe** `~master-morzod` got full HTTPS support working on the testnet! Ted also wrote up a new UP on his thoughts on Urbit parallelism. Check that out [here](https://fora.urbit.org/proposals/posts/~2018.7.28..19.57.33..7ed3~/). 

The Interface team worked more on Landscape, our application to allow better communication and collaboration.  **Galen** `~ravmel-ropdyl`, **Gavin** `~ridlur-figbud`, and **Jimmy** `~haptyl-wanwes` continued their iterative design revision feedback process, and Landscape is looking good. **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn` and **Logan** `~tacryt-socryp` continued implementing the latest desktop/mobile features to get the product ready to ship, as well as extending support for the latest backend Landscape API’s that **Isaac V** `~davtyr-nimren` has been improving. Urbit is becoming more usable by the day.

Last but not least, the Documentation team continued doing `~zod`’s work helping teach Urbit to the world. **Josh** `~taglux-nidsep` extended his new Hoon docs to cover Hoon cores, an introduction to the Hoon standard library, and a couple of Hoon examples with very detailed walkthrough commentary (drafts [here](https://github.com/joshuareagan/doc-drafts)). And **Robert** `~lodleb-ritrul` extended the current Hoon-standard-library documentation on random atom generation and atom scrambling, as well as the Hoon cores for computing modular and signed-integer arithmetic (`urbit/docs` pull requests [here](https://github.com/urbit/docs/pulls)). Very soon you’ll actually be able to understand how Urbit works.

Also: we’ll be hosting another party this month on Friday, August 10th. Save the date! Link: [meetup.com: Urbit IRL ~2018.8](https://www.meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/253292678/)

Okay! Have a great week.
