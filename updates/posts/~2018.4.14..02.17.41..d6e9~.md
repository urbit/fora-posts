Replacing the internet is hard. Luckily, we have great people helping us do it. Here’s what’s new this week in Urbit:

We hired more people! Tlon is pleased to have with us:

- **Erik** `~patnes-rigtyn` - Erik is our new head of operations. He’ll be keeping us all fed and organized, as well as helping us with some legal things.
- **Joe** `~master-morzod` - Joe... well, [you know Joe](https://joemfb.github.io/ez-urbits/). He’s going to help us make Urbit easier.
- **Logan** `~tacryt-socryp` - Logan is going to build us a mobile app, work on which has already begun! Very exciting, indeed.

**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` and **Elliot** `~littel-ponnys` have been working more on [new Ford](https://fora.urbit.org/proposals/posts/~2018.3.15..04.24.35..a47f~/). They turbocharged the `+execute` algorithm to use a worklist data structure. This will not only be simpler to reason about, but in the future, it will allow future support for parallelization of builds at the Vere level in MapReduce fashion. Their work is on [Github](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/ford-turbo).

**Curtis** `~sorreg-namtyv` has been working hard to make Hoon’s type system less confusing, as well as working on the problem of data inspection in Hoon. Now that his “structure-to-type” code is mostly done (going from an abstract type definition to its real compiled internal representation), he’ll soon be done with his “type-to-structure” reverse converter for getting abstract structure data out of any sets of values. More soon, but all of this will supersede the current mold system and help make Hoon easier to understand, we think.

**Galen** `~ravmel-ropdyl`, **Anton** `~pittyp-datfyn`, **Jimmy** `~haptyl-wanwes`, **Gavin** `~ridlur-figbud`, **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn`, and **Logan** `~tacryt-socryp` have been putting in more hard work on the new Urbit frontend. It’s all coming together really nicely, and things seem to be on schedule for a big mid-to-late summer release.

We haven’t posted an obscure graphic in a while. Here’s one for the update to tide you over:

What it’s for is totally top secret.

**Keaton** `~tonlur-sarret` deployed sections to Fora, which will help categorize discussion content better and lead to better curation of StackOverflow-like questions and Urbit Proposals (UPs). He also merged some important pull requests into the system and deployed them to the network.

**Mikolaj** `~ponmep-litsem`’s contributor work on moving Vere from Make to the [Meson](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson) build system was merged this week. This solves several issues with bundling of dependencies, as well as making binary builds generally faster. Great work!

**Joe** `~master-morzod` got his [HTTP pull request](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/942) finally merged, which rewrites Vere’s HTTP client and server to use the `h2o` library. This is great, as it will allow for full TLS termination in Urbit, which sets us up for full HTTPS connections to direct IP addresses of Urbit ships at `your-ship.urbit.org`, to be fully implemented soon.

**Robert** `~lodleb-ritrul` has made a number of helpful PR’s  to the [Urbit docs](https://github.com/urbit/docs).

**Mark** `~palfun-foslup` worked more on the Urbit constitution and put out some important fires caused by code-update syncs over the network and type mismatches. Computers are hard!

**Joshua** `~taglux-nidsep`, Ted, Keaton, and Joe went on [Mars Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZKNLcdRbE0) to discuss the Facebook data scandal, the greater battle for privacy and personal computing, and Urbit’s role in all of this. We think it turned out great.

All in all, life has been good over here. Now it’s time for a good weekend. See you all on the network!
