It’s an exciting time here at Tlon.

The Keys team is toiling to make the Urbit Wallet air-tight and foolproof. The
Urbit Wallet, a cousin to the more typical cryptocurrency wallet, is an original
system for securing cryptographic assets. It’s original enough to demand its own
Manual, a document that **Will** `~hadrud-lodsef`, **Rob** `~lodleb-ritrul`, and
**Morgan** `~hidrel-fabtel` are in the process of perfecting. The Wallet Manual
will be a one-stop shop for information on using the Urbit Wallet system, both
general concepts and technical details.

Someone claiming to have solved a sufficiently large task with their first
attempt is probably lying. The Keys team are an honest bunch, and they’ve
decided to simplify our in-house wallet-generation software into something that
produces one Urbit Wallet for each ship. That wallet generator provides secret
keys to users in the form of PDFs, and these PDFs have been redesigned by
**Gavin** `~riglur-figbud` so that they are more informative and easier to
organize.

Gavin and **Jimmy** `~fallyn-balfus` are designing the UI flows for software
that takes the grief out of accessing your ships on the blockchain. This is
distinct from the aforementioned wallet-generation software which helps you secure 
your ships on the blockchain, but we will soon to merge the two apps into a combined
application known as Bridge.

Our foreign correspondents are lending their talents to the Bridge mission.
New Zealand’s **Jared** `~nidsut-tomdun` has been working on the attendant
key-derivation library, and is also creating the library for displaying
Urbit Wallet tickets as human-memorable strings. **Mark** `~palfun-foslup`, our
beloved Dutchman, worked with Jared to develop a JavaScript interface to the
Urbit constitution.

The infrastructure team has labored clanking towards the goal of making Vere
less clanky. Two of **Paul's** `~fodwyt-ragful` changes -- a custom-bytecode
Nock interpreter and a new jet dashboard -- have been integrated, resulting in a
faster and more robust Urbit. Nock itself was updated, too, with the notable
addition being the Nock 12 “edit” operator. Paul, **Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer`, and
Joe `~master-morzod` joined forces to make this happen, and borrowed our
resident logician **Josh** `~taglux-nidsep` from the docs team to check it for
correctness.

All of the above points to the big enchilada: using the Constitution as the
address registry for the Urbit network. Mark has capped off this week’s progress
by booting the Urbit testnet (with all the new Landscape features) against an
Ethereum testnet, so now we can do our best to break it. Things are about to get
real.

See you next week.

Rob `~lodleb-ritrul`
