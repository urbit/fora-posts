Short week this week as we recover from the holidays. The biggest news item is that our fork of MyEtherWallet is now complete! 

Feel free to download it and try it out: https://github.com/urbit/etherwallet

Thanks to **Anthony** `~poldec-tonteg` for building it and to Mark for testing it.

**Mark** `~palfun-foslup` has diagnosed [a tricky bug](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues/533) involving what appeared to be one-way communication in Gall. More updates on that forthcoming.

**Galen** `~ravmel-ropdyl` has been working on the Urbit primer that will become the new urbit.org landing page. That's in review now.

**Curtis** `~sorreg-namtyv` has been helping out with the primer and has begun work on an HTTP cache in Vere to help with web performance. That should synergize nicely with upcoming Ford fixes.

**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` has been modernizing his and Anton's work on Ford caching to work with new Hoon and Arvo.

**Keaton** `~tonlur-sarret` has been helping Ted with Ford. With Mark's help, he also moved Fora onto a standalone ship to improve the loading times of the rest of urbit.org. All the old links still work, but Fora's true home is now at [https://fora.urbit.org](https://fora.urbit.org).

**Isaac** `~davtyr-nimren` has made some [more progress](https://github.com/ixv/arvo/commit/bc52d9fc494399c2063cfa7817046d180b6f78d5) on the new static webpage serving (`ren/tree`).

Early 2018 should see a lot of usability improvements. We're looking forward to being able to ship them soon.
