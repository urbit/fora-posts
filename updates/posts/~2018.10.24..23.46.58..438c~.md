Here’s a short update from the team at Tlon for the week of `~2018.10.24`:

The heroic efforts of **Mark** `~palfun-foslup` have ensured that the Ethereum
testnet Constitution is transacting properly, all in the face of the testnet
itself encountering a consensus-failure bug. We can now test various pieces of our 
tooling and Urbit functionality against really existing blockchain state.

On the Landscape side, **Logan** `~tacryt-socryp` and **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn`
finished integration between the mobile app and its desktop counterpart so that
there is a QR-code pairing functionality. These interfaces are now in shape for
internal testing.

**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` has brought important changes to our build system,
Ford. The latest, fastest version of that system is titled Ford Fiesta, and
it's shaping up to have all the Spartan utility that its name indicates: stack
traces, new Ford-specific runes, and a parser for those runes. Ted also tweaked
Clay and Gall so that they use Ford Fiesta for builds.

In one of our cavernous basement labs, we've been poking away at a replacement 
for our beleagured HTTP server, `%eyre`. This new beast, dubbed `%light` has 
benefited from the talents of **Elliot** `~littel-ponnys`. A test version of this new vane 
can now hold a connection open and send a steady stream of HTTP data to the client. 
Big things have small beginnings...

See you next week.

Rob `~lodleb-ritrul`
