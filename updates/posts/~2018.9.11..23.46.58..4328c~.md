I've gone short on words and long on links for this update, since sometimes the code speaks 
for itself.

![1.](https://media.urbit.org/fora/updates/2018.9.11-update-1.jpg)

After much gnashing of teeth and abuse of git, we now have a 
[release candidate](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/release-candidate) 
branch (NB run with the [correct](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/tree/release-candidate) 
vere branch). This branch brings together, for the first time, a few long-running 
lines of development. `%ford-turbo`, our new and improved [reactive build 
system](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/release-candidate/sys/vane/ford.hoon), 
totally replaces `%old-ford` on this branch (take a look at those comments!). 
Proud papa **Joe** `~master-morzod` [hard work](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/release-candidate/app/acme.hoon) 
on HTTPS proxying is baked right in (meaning that ship.urbit.org is graduating 
from novelty to utility). `%jael` now actually [holds your secrets](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/release-candidate/sys/vane/jael.hoon) and is being 
used to boot ships. **Curtis'** `~sorreg-namtyv` swansong as the auteur behind 
`hoon` is now included (a crispy new styleguide is also in the works). Various 
niceties related to our new web ui are in here (_au revoir_ old Fora and Webtalk), 
as well as an actually existing [test](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/release-candidate/gen/test.hoon) 
framework and all kinds of crypto goodies. This release candidate will get the 
testnet treatment for a little while, while we confirm that it's good enough for you, dear 
Martian.

Much of the Infrastructure team is living the life of the fireman: making chili with your friends 
interspersed with someone yelling at you to put out a fire. Except, instead of making chili, 
**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` is redesigning the Ford Rune language (why should `~sorreg-namtyv` 
get all the fun?) and **Elliot** `~littel-ponnys` is bringing `%eyre` into the new Millenium. 
**Mark** `~palfun-foslup` and **Joe** `~master-morzod`, though, continue in their quest to make Ethereum 
safe for Martians and **Ben** continues his grueling (for some value of gruel) pair programming regime 
with **Curtis** `~sorreg-namtyv`.

**Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn`, **Isaac** `~davtyr-nimren`, **Jimmy** `~fallyn-balfus` and **Logan** `~tacryt-socryp`
continue refining our new web UI, Landscape. Fonts have been argued over, tables overturned over 
line heights. But it will all be worth it in the end.

The Keys crew (**Will** `~hadrud-lodsef`, **Morgan** `~hidrel-fabtel` and **Gavin** `~ridlur-figbud`) are 
forming like Voltron to get our address space ported over and make sure that we can generate our HD wallets in a secure, 
usable way. They are joined by the newest edition to Tlon: **Jared** `~nidsut-tomdun`. **Jared** is 
down south New Zealand way, bringing Tlon ever closer to our goal of `%amesing` over the entire globe. Say 
"|hi"!

Next year on Mars!
