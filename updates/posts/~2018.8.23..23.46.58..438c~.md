At Tlon, oars have been bent for some time towards getting the [Urbit PKI 
bootstrapped on Ethereum](https://urbit.org/blog/2017.9-eth/). Well: 
The end is in sight! We're not ones to curse an estimate with "dates," so let's 
say it's "forthcoming." 

This effort has spurred all kinds of updates to the system, most of which 
were long in the coming and all of which will have benefits far beyond the 
Ethereum roll out. We're excited to share them with y'all.

We've finalized our suggested wallet derivation scheme. This was a monumental 
effort that included the expertise of a lot of different parts of Tlon, 
thanks to **Morgan** `~hidrel-fabtel`, **Curtis** `~sorreg-namtyv`, **Will** 
`~hadrud-lodsef` and **Mark** `~palfun-foslup`! Look forward to a full public 
announcement of this derivation scheme once the audit has taken place.  

Now that that's all wrapped up, we are finalizing work on client-side tools 
for generating and decrypting these wallets in a usable way. **Gavin** `~ridlur-figbud` and **Will** `~hadrud-lodsef` 
have been leading this effort, with a non-trivial wasm assist from **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn` and 
**Mark** `~palfun-foslup` (codenamed the Dutch Destroyer). We now have parity between the front 
end crypto tools and their hoon-side cousins.  

A key part of this is also the Wallet application, which will allow you to 
manage your assets easily. **Morgan** `~hidrel-fabtel` has changed the Wallet 
application architecture a bit to accomodate our wallet deriviation scheme and 
we're working on getting those changes implemented. **Robert** `~lodleb-ritrul` 
is on loan from the Docs team to help us make sure that all of our documentation 
and copy around these tools is crystal clear.  

A thread connecting these projects is our concept of the Sigil, some of the 
cryptic shapes you may have seen gracing these very updates. An urbit ship is 
unique cryptographic property and a Sigil is the visual equivalent of your 
pronounceable shipname. Sigils will grace our applications for interacting 
with the urbit Constitution, our new Landscape UI and many other places we've 
dreamt up. Work on these Sigils has reached a good point and we're working on 
integrating them into these applications.  

Webtalk is not long for this world, into the breach will step: Landscape. 
After a lot of prototyping and design iteration, we've settled on a feature 
set that will help the Urbit community (that's you!) communicate and 
collaborate to reach our next incarnation. Landscape will be on your computer 
and in your pocket. **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn` and **Jimmy** `~haptyl-wanwes` have been hard at work hitting the 
details of the design implementation, including nuances like 
disconnected and reconnected states and other interaction concepts that we 
think you'll like. **Logan** `~tacryt-socryp` has been doing double duty on 
Mobile and improving `%hall` support for DMs. Needless to say, Sigils are 
present throughout.

What about Arvo, you say? Well, the latest news is a veritable supercollision 
of a merge between our various long running lines of work. [Ford Turbo](https://fora.urbit.org/proposals/posts/~2018.3.15..04.24.35..a47f~/), whose 
development you've all been following closely, is now in the process of being 
integrated with the rest of the our code, complete with not one but two caches (thanks 
**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer`). **Elliot** `~littel-ponnys` is taking on the task of 
integrating Ford Turbo with various affordance we've added in support of 
Landscape. **Joe** `~master-morzod`, meanwhile, is integrating updates to ames and the boot 
process occasioned by the Ethereum bootstrap. And finally, **Curtis'** `~sorreg-namtyv` long-
anticipated improvements to hoon are being incorporated into all of the above.  

The last of these changes will be of particular interest to new learners of 
hoon, since one of their benefits is the ability to pretty print type 
information; a useful tool when working in the %dojo.

**Josh** `~taglux-nidsep` is closing out a revision of the docs to be released very soon. We 
hope that the new docs and friendlier hoon will make the task of learning hoon less 
of a task and more of an adventure. 

Next year on Mars!
