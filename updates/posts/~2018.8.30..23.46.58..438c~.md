Here is a smattering of the exciting things going on at Tlon this week.

Now that we know what the infrastructure for transferring our current 
property registry will look like, **Will** `~hadrud-lodsef`, **Morgan** `~hidrel-fabtel` are 
getting the logistics in order. Primary to this is securely generating new 
keys and securely transferring existing assets. Since Tlon owns a _bit_ of 
address space, we're particularly interested in making sure this transfer 
goes down smoothly! 

The Landscape team has been busy integrating changes to Collections (our new 
concept for writing, reading and subscribing to static files...like this one!). 
Our very own Canadian visionary **Isaac** `~davtyr-nimren` did a redesign recently that makes this 
system more general and takes advantage of the permissions in our file system, `%clay`.

Of course, what kind of a square only chats from their desk? Don't most of us 
want to chat from our soylent-powered electric scooters as well? Luckily, wunderkinder
**Logan** `~tacryt-socryp` and **Jimmy** `~haptyl-wanwes` have been grinding on 
Landscape mobile, including new features such as slick navigation, an improved DM 
flow and, maybe most importantly, a QR-based device pairing flow.

**Mark**, resident solidity jurist, is busy updating `%jael` (our vane for handling secrets) 
to accomodate our newest Constitution 

**Joe** `~master-morzod` is making good use of his time in the office to make everyone else 
feel unproductive. Not only is he the maestro behind the mergepocalypse that I mentioned 
last week, he is also finishing up work on booting a ship using a keypair generated by, 
you guessed it, the front end key tools mentioned above.

Ford Turbo is getting a good work out from its integration with the updates we made to `%arvo` 
to accomodate Landscape. Dynamic duo **Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` and **Elliot** `~littel-ponnys` 
are fixing these bugs and updating the test suite to account for these cases. 

Last but not least **David** `~patpex_ponleg` joins the Docs crew. **David** has experience 
teaching programming, and has even used Hoon in his classes. We're happy to have him help us 
teach the world to hoon. Come and say hi to him on `%talk`, or even better, ask him to help you 
with your hoon homework ;)

Next year on Mars!
