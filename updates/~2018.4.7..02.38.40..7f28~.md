As always, the Urbit community has been working hard this week to replace the internet. Here’s a summary: 

We’re hosting [Hoon School](https://www.meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/249019207/) at our San Francisco office this Sunday. Come, bring your laptop, and we’ll get you started building things in Urbit’s language -- Hoon. 

Tlon has brought on two new interns! We’re excited to have with us:

- **Gavin** `~ridlur-figbud` - Gavin’s going to help us with some promising frontend design projects.
- **Robert** `~lodleb-ritrul` - Robert’s going to work with us on revamping our documentation, examples, and blog, writing high-quality original content. He has submitted several pull requests to the docs already this week, which have been merged.

**Galen** `~ravmel-ropdyl`, **Anton** `~pittyp-datfyn`, **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn`, and **Jimmy** `~haptyl-wanwes` have been continuing to advance the state of the new Urbit frontend.

**Mark** `~palfun-foslup` has been working hard with **Curtis** `~sorreg-namtyv` to bring the Urbit constitution into its final, launchable state. He believes it’s ready for its final security audit, which keeps us on track to launch it this summer. You can find the latest contract code [here](https://github.com/urbit/constitution).

**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` and **Elliot** `~littel-ponnys` have assembled a basic prototype of the main engine of the new Ford redesign. They’ve been improving the design as they go, posting updates as comments to the [original Fora post](https://fora.urbit.org/posts/~2018.3.15..04.24.35..a47f~/). Their code can be found [here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/ford-turbo). 

Lastly, big shoutout to **Mikolaj** `~ponmep-litsem` for his work on [Plato](http://plato.urbitetorbi.org:8080/plato.html), which now allows remote Hoon code execution without logging in. This is a big step towards improving our developer onboarding, as it will allow newcomers to experience interactive Urbit programming in the browser quickly without having to wait to boot their own ship. See Mikolaj’s original thread on Github [here](https://github.com/urbit/docs/issues/239).

We look forward to teaching some of you this Sunday the beginnings of the art of Martian functional programming. To all else, we’ll see you on the network. Have a great weekend, everybody!
