**Galen** `~ravmel-ropdyl`, **Anthony** `~poldec-tonteg`, **Chris** `~sigtus-hossyn`,  **Jimmy** `~haptyl-wanwes`, and **Anton** `~pittyp-datfyn` have continued the push toward the new Urbit frontend.

**Curtis** `~sorreg-namtyv` has been working more on simplifying default value calculation in the Hoon type system.

**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` and **Keaton** `~tonlur-sarret` have a design for a better Ford caching and rebuilding architecture, and are now converting it to a UP to be reviewed by the community.

**Mark** `~palfun-foslup` submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/651) that implements the _Keccak_ family of cryptographic hashing functions in Hoon, including `SHA-3`, `shake`, and `rawshake`. We’ll need `keccak` to integrate Urbit with Ethereum.

Also, [moons](https://urbit.org/docs/using/admin/#-moons) are back! You can run the `+moon` generator from your galaxy, star or planet to create a ticket for a new moon. If you run your ship in the cloud and SSH in to use Talk, try booting a moon on your laptop and using that for Talk instead. Messages you send from your moon will appear to have been sent from your usual (parent) identity.

**Iceman** `~littel-ponnys` wrote some deep thoughts on Clay, Urbit’s filesystem, in this [meaty Fora post](https://fora.urbit.org/posts/~2018.2.25..02.28.04..bd6d~/).

P.S. We’re hiring! If you’re interested, email `galen@tlon.io`.
