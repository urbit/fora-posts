This week:
**Galen** `~ravmel-ropdyl`, **Curtis** `~sorreg-namtyv`, and **Jimmy** continued work on the upcoming Urbit primer for the website.

**Keaton** `~tonlur-sarret` is almost done converting the documentation to Urbit-flavored markdown, building on the work of **Isaac** `~davtyr-nimren`.

**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` has been working with Anton on better Ford caching performance.

**Anton** `~pittyp-datfyn` has been doing some work with **Joe** `~master-morzod` on [automated Vere memory verification](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/915).

**Mark** has a [PR to fix a talk / Gall bug](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/538) and is now working on updating Clay’s API to support multiple files per request, which will support the Ford caching improvements.

**Iceman** `~littel-ponnys` has submitted a [PR implementing a unit testing framework](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/539) for Hoon, which had been in the works for a long time.

**Mikolaj** `~ponmep-litsem` has been making lots of good contributions recently, including reporting several GitHub issues and work on an Elm web frontend for Urbit, which he’s using to implement [Plato](https://github.com/mikolajpp/plato), an in-browser Hoon editor.

Finally, in [Mars Talk this week](https://youtu.be/oX7TFJ5qzr4) Ted wrote a Gall app using a timer from Behn with help from Keaton and **Josh** `~taglux-nidsep`.
